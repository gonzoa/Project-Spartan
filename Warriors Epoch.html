      <P> This is Astrid. She was undiagnosed for years until she was 20 and developed tonic clonic seizures. "I never thought I could be diagnosed in my adult life, I was shocked. At first, it was hard to accept my diagnosis, but now I have made healthier choices in lifestyle and I am back to being myself." Her diagnosis came after she finished her undergrad and it didn't stop her form getting her MBA. Astrid we salute you this week! Keep on fighting!!</P>
